2013 June Colorado Wildfires by Glen Letham

This is an example of how quickly you can publish geodata. The data was compiled by Glem Letham and [available as a kml](http://extras.denverpost.com/media/maps/kml/2013/ColoradoWildfires2013BlackForestRoyalGorgeBigMeadows.kml). I used ogr2ogr to convert the kml to geojson and pushed it to github. Voil√†, instant map.
